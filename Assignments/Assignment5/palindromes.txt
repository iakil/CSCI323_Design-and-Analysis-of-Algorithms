Don’t nod.
Evil olive.
Amore, Roma.
Yo, banana boy!
Dammit, I’m mad!
Borrow or rob?
I did, did I?
Draw, O coward!
Wonton? Not now!
Never odd or even.
Step on no pets.

Delia saw I was ailed.
Too bad I hid a boot.
Red rum, sir, is murder.
Nate bit a Tibetan.
Ah. Satan sees Natasha.
As I pee, sir, I see Pisa!
Sit on a potato pan, Otis.
A man, a plan, a canal: Panama.
Amy? Must I jujitsu my ma?
A nut for a jar of tuna.
Murder for a jar of red rum.
Al lets Della call Ed “Stella.”
Oh, who was it I saw? Oh, who?
Cigar? Toss it in a can. It is so tragic.
Pull up, Eva! we’re here! Wave! Pull up!
Anne, I vote more cars race Rome to Vienna.
Ed, I saw Harpo Marx ram Oprah W. aside.
Was it a car or a cat I saw?
Oozy rat in a sanitary zoo.

Eva, can I see bees in a cave?
Ma is a nun, as I am.
Ma is as selfless as I am.
Did Hannah see bees? Hannah did.
Doc, note I dissent: a fast never prevents a fatness. I diet on cod.
Are we not drawn onward, we few, drawn onward to new era?
